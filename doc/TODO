Bugs:

- There's some memory trashing bug or bug with the garbage collector, which
  seems to be fixed by turning the gc off. I should see if makeing malloc
  protect freed regions hits the bug. If not. is it reasonable to assume the
  GC is broken? If we're not trashing freed regions, then the bug should show
  up with the GC off too, since it probably means we're trashing still in use
  regions? Right?

  It usually shows up as things being incorrectly unbound or when starting up
  or first loading. Changing memory placement, changes when or where it
  happens. Such as changing the size of the symbol table.

  Of course with the GC off you can't do too much consing, like fib(41)
  without memoization.

- I think there was a problem with loading and the parser not properly getting
  reset and set up. It seems like I fixed loading, but now you have to hit ^D
  twice before it recognises and EOF (and gets to call yywrap).

Problems:

General:

- format-out()
  - doesn't work right
    format-out("(%=)", 23);
    it outputs: "()\n23"
  - really slow

- debugging for load() sucks
  - add line number tracking
    x Did a quick word-around. When DEBUG and !SMALL_OBJECTS, I added the
      ability for objects to remember the source location where they were
      created. This isn't necessarily anywhere near where the error occurs,
      but at least it's a clue. It doesn't seem to be that useful from the
      error messages. It's mostly useful when running in a debugger.

      To do this better might require some parser re-design. Most errors seem
      to happen at eval time. When loading files the parser state is gone
      before we even start evaluation.

- constants can be modified
- constant slots not supported, no "constant" slot adjective

- No macros, "macro" is not a keyword

- object-hash() is missing

- define library is missing
  - I'd like to at least just add the syntax with the goal of being able to
    run simple tests using the same source in both mindy and marlais.
    We can make real libraries later.

Syntax:

- Doesn't support unicode string escapes
  e.g. "\<44>\<79>\<6c>\<61>\<6e>" = "Dylan";

- \name isn't recognized
  e.g. let \if = "if";

Internal:

- Without SMALL_OBJECTS sizeof(struct object) is 76 (too big)
- With SMALL_OBJECTS values are too limited

- I think the distinction between keywords and symbols is *bogus*, but I'm not
  totally convinced there's not something that relies on it. In particular, I
  think that having a colon ":" at the end of keyword string values is not
  right. It put the colons on when defining built-in keywords. It there some
  reason that keywords and symbols must be distinct? #"foo" == foo: so why
  should else_keyword != make_keyword("else") ?  Also then you have to take
  the colon off and put it on for converting back and forth from
  keyword<->symbol.  Perhaps there's some confusion with source record
  keywords? Or perhaps some holdover from prefix syntax?

dma's list (from the web page)

1. First, we'll fix any inconsistancies of the functions defined in the Dylan
Reference Manual (DRM), chapter 12.  Actually, this task isn't so herculean,
as most of the function and class bindings are correct, see the bindings list
for what needs to be done.
 
2. Next, we'll implement as much as the common-dylan spec described in the
 Common Dylan and Functional Extensions Reference

3. Finally, we'll implement the hygenic macro system, and then, reimplement
the basic "syntax" using macros and in accordance with chapter 14 of the DRM.

Enhancements:

- Readline
  - completions
    - on symbols
    - on grammar
  x paren flashing

- ffi 
  - minimal
  - full blown like fun-o / gwydion

after ffi:

- sql
  - consider targeting towards fun-o

- curses
  - ya

- network streams

- Fast load/dump
  - simple
    format:
      magic #
      format description (endianness, sizes?)
      binary parsed objects
  - look at DOOD

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change Log: (incomplete)

- makefile changes
- added config.h, pulled out some config vars, made some new ones
- ffi
- loading bug?
- debug source info in objects
- paren matching in readline
