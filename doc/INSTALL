If your machine is not contained in the MACHINES file, see PORTING for
information on porting to your architecture.

Edit config.h for your platform and preferences.

Modify the variables in the Makefile, if necessary:
  CC
	Your ANSI C compiler
  CFLAGS
	Special flags for your ANSI C compiler
  INIT_FILE
	Where to find the initialization file
  READLINE_FLAGS
	If you defined HAS_READLINE this may @@@

NOTE: Regenerating the Makefile dependencies (a.k.a make depend) currently
will probably only work with gcc. If you develop on a machine without gcc, you
may need to regenerate dependencies another way.

Modify the MARLAIS_INIT variable to point to the place where the
initialization file, init.dylan, will be kept.

Type make.
